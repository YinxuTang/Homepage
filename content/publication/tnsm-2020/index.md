abstract: In software-defined networking (SDN) systems, it is a common practice
  to adopt a multi-controller design and control devolution techniques to
  improve the performance of the control plane. However, in such systems the
  decision-making for joint switch-controller association and control devolution
  often involves various uncertainties, e.g., the temporal variations of
  controller accessibility, and computation and communication costs of switches.
  In practice, statistics of such uncertainties are unattainable and need to be
  learned in an online fashion, calling for an integrated design of learning and
  control. In this article, we formulate a stochastic network optimization
  problem that aims to minimize time-average system costs and ensure queue
  stability. By transforming the problem into a combinatorial multi-armed bandit
  problem with long-term stability constraints, we adopt bandit learning methods
  and optimal control techniques to handle the exploration-exploitation tradeoff
  and long-term stability constraints, respectively. Through an integrated
  design of online learning and online control, we propose an effective
  Learning-Aided Switch-Controller Association and Control Devolution (LASAC)
  scheme. Our theoretical analysis and simulation results show that LASAC
  achieves a tunable tradeoff between queue stability and system cost reduction
  with a sublinear time-averaged regret bound over a finite time horizon.

summary: "In fog-assisted IoT systems, it is a common practice to cache popular
  content at the network edge to achieve high quality of service. Due to various
  uncertainties such as unknown file popularities in practice, the design of
  effective cache placement scheme is still an open problem with two key
  challenges: 1) how to incorporate online learning into the cache placement
  process to minimize performance loss (a.k.a. regret), and 2) how to maintain
  caching costs under budgets in the long run. In this paper, we formulate the
  content cache placement problem with unknown file popularities as a
  combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem with long-term time-average
  constraints. We adopt bandit learning methods and virtual queue technique to
  deal with the exploration-exploitation tradeoff and long-term time-average
  constraints, respectively. With an effective integration of online learning
  and online control, we devise a learning-aided cache placement scheme called
  CPB (Cache Placement with Bandit Learning). Our theoretical analysis and
  simulation results show that CPB achieves a tunable sublinear regret over a
  finite time horizon and keeps caching costs within budgets in the long run."

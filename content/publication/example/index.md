abstract: Emoji prediction has been widely adopted in most mobile keyboards to
  improve the quality of user experience. Considering the energy limitations of
  smartphones, it is promising to consider deploying pre-trained prediction
  models on edge servers, with which smartphones can carry out emoji prediction
  in an online fashion. However, given a limited connection capacity, a key
  issue under such a scheme lies in how each smartphone should select a subset
  of models to achieve high-accuracy and real-time emoji prediction with energy
  efficiency (a.k.a. the model selection problem). Moreover, part of the system
  dynamics such as the accuracy and the latency of individual models are usually
  unknown a priori in practice, further complicating the problem. In this paper,
  with an effective integration of history-aware online learning and online
  control, we propose the first green edge intelligence scheme to solve the
  model selection problem for edge-assisted mobile keyboard emoji prediction.
  Our theoretical analysis and simulation results verify the effectiveness of
  our proposed scheme in achieving a sublinear regret bound and energy
  efficiency with high accuracy and low latency.

abstract: Equipped with specific IoT on-board devices, unmanned aerial vehicles
  (UAVs) can be orchestrated to assist in particular value-added service
  delivery with improved quality-of-service. Typically, services are delegated
  in the unit of tasks to a designated leader UAV, while the leader UAV splits
  each task into sub-tasks and offloads them to part of its nearby UAVs, a.k.a.
  helper UAVs, for timely processing. Such a decision making process, often
  referred to as UAV task offloading, still remains open and challenging to
  design, due to various uncertainties therein, such as the resource
  availability and instant workloads on helper UAVs. However, existing solutions
  often assume the knowledge of system dynamics is fully available and conduct
  decision making in an offline manner, resulting in excessive control overheads
  and scalability issues. In this paper, we study the UAV task offloading
  problem in an online setting and formulate it as a multi-armed bandits (MAB)
  problem with time-varying resource constraints. Then we propose VR-LATOS, a
  learning-aided offloading scheme that learns the unknown statistics from
  feedback signals while making effective offloading decisions in an online
  fashion. Results from both theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate
  that VR-LATOS outperforms state-of-the-art schemes.

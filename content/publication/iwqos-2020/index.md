abstract: In software-defined networking (SDN) systems, it is a common practice
  to adopt a multi-controller design and control devolution techniques to
  improve the performance of the control plane. However, in such systems the
  decision making for joint switch-controller association and control devolution
  often involves various uncertainties, e.g., the temporal variations of
  controller accessibility, and computation and communication costs of switches.
  In practice, statistics of such uncertainties are unattainable and need to be
  learned in an online fashion, calling for an integrated design of learning and
  control. In this paper, we formulate a stochastic network optimization problem
  that aims to minimize time-average system costs and ensure queue stability. By
  transforming the problem into a combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem with
  long-term stability constraints, we adopt bandit learning methods and optimal
  control techniques to handle the exploration-exploitation tradeoff and
  long-term stability constraints, respectively. Through an integrated design of
  online learning and online control, we propose an effective Learning-Aided
  Switch-Controller Association and Control Devolution (LASAC) scheme. Our
  theoretical analysis and simulation results show that LASAC achieves a tunable
  tradeoff between queue stability and system cost reduction with a sublinear
  regret bound over a finite time horizon.

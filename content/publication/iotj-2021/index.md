abstract: "In fog-assisted Internet-of-Things systems, it is a common practice
  to cache popular content at the network edge to achieve high quality of
  service. Due to uncertainties, in practice, such as unknown file popularities,
  the cache placement scheme design is still an open problem with unresolved
  challenges: 1) how to maintain time-averaged storage costs under budgets; 2)
  how to incorporate online learning to aid cache placement to minimize
  performance loss [also known as (a.k.a.) regret]; and 3) how to exploit
  offline historical information to further reduce regret. In this article, we
  formulate the cache placement problem with unknown file popularities as a
  constrained combinatorial multiarmed bandit problem. To solve the problem, we
  employ virtual queue techniques to manage time-averaged storage cost
  constraints, and adopt history-aware bandit learning methods to integrate
  offline historical information into the online learning procedure to handle
  the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. With an effective combination of online
  control and history-aware online learning, we devise a cache placement scheme
  with history-aware bandit learning called CPHBL. Our theoretical analysis and
  simulations show that CPHBL achieves a sublinear time-averaged regret bound.
  Moreover, the simulation results verify CPHBLâ€™s advantage over the deep
  reinforcement learning-based approach."

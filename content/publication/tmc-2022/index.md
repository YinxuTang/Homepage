abstract: >
  Emoji prediction has been widely adopted in most mobile keyboards to improve
  the quality of user experience. Considering the resource constraints of
  smartphones, it is promising to deploy pre-trained prediction models on edge
  servers, with which smartphones can carry out emoji prediction in an online
  fashion. However, a key issue in such a scenario lies in how the smartphone
  should select a subset of models to achieve high-accuracy and real-time emoji
  prediction with energy efficiency (a.k.a. the model selection problem).
  Moreover, part of the system dynamics such as the prediction accuracy and the
  inference latency of each model are usually unknown a priori in practice,
  further complicating the problem. In this paper, with an effective integration
  of history-aware online learning and online control, we propose the first
  green edge intelligence scheme to solve the model selection problem for mobile
  keyboard emoji prediction. Our theoretical analysis and simulation results
  verify the effectiveness of our proposed scheme in achieving a sub-linear
  round-averaged regret bound and energy efficiency with a high prediction
  accuracy and a low latency.
